NAHLN-Rhapsody
==============

Example of NAHLN using Orion Health Rhapsody 
http://www.orionhealth.com/rhapsody-integration-engine


The RLC file can be loaded directly into Rhapsody
Symphonia Mapper can be used to change the mapping code found here

This project takes an XML message from VetView (LIMS) and translates it into a 
valid HL7 NAHLN CSF message (based on schema 1.0.8)

MORE DETAILS TO COME AT A LATER DATE
